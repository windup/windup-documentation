[id=mta-6-ui-interface-views]
== User interface views

The {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} has two views:

* Administration view
* Migration view

In *Administration* view, you configure the instance environment, working with credentials, repositories, HTTP and HTTPS proxy definitions, custom migration targets, and issue management.

In *Migration* view, you perform application assessments and analyses, review reports, and add applications for assessment and analysis.

* Downloading HTML reports
* Downloading CSV reports

[id="configuring-credentials"]
=== Configuring credentials

You can configure the following types of credentials in *Administration* view:

* Source control
* Maven
* Proxy

[id="creating-configuring-jira-connection"]
== Creating and configuring a Jira connection

You can track application migrations by creating a Jira issue for each migration from within the {ProductShortName} {WebName}. To be able to create Jira issues, you first need to do the following:

. Create an {ProductShortName} credential to authenticate to the API of the Jira instance that you create in the next step.
. Create a Jira instance in {ProductShortName} and establish a connection to that instance.

include::topics/mta-web-config-jira-credentials.adoc[leveloffset=2]
include::topics/mta-web-create-config-jira-connection.adoc[leveloffset=2]

[NOTE]
====
A Jira connection that was used for xref:../../../docs/topics/mta-web-creating-jira-issues-for-migration-wave.adoc#mta-web-creating-jira-issues-for-migration-wave_{context}[creating issues for a migration wave] cannot be removed as long as the issues exist in Jira, even after the migration wave is deleted.

[id="assessing-and-analyzing-applications"]
== Assessing and analyzing applications with MTA
You can use the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} to assess and analyze applications:

* When assessing applications, {ProductShortName} estimates the risks and costs involved in preparing applications for containerization, including time, personnel, and other factors. You can use the results of an assessment for discussions between stakeholders to determine whether applications are suitable for containerization.

* When analyzing applications, {ProductShortName} uses rules to determine which specific lines in an application must be modified before the application can be migrated or modernized.
