[id=mta-6-ui-interface-views]
== User interface views

The {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} has two uviews:

* Administrator view
* Developer view

In *Administrator* view, you configure the instance environment, working with credentials, repositories, and HTTP and HTTPS proxy definitions.

In *Developer* view, you perform application assessments and analyses, review reports, and add applications for assessment and analysis.

== Configuring the instance environment

You can configure the following in *Administrator* view:

* Credentials
* Repositories
* HTTP and HTTPS proxy settings

[id="configuring-credentials"]
=== Configuring credentials

You can configure the following types of credentials in *Administrator* view:

* Source control
* Maven
* Proxy

[id="configuring-repositories"]
=== Configuring repositories

You can configure the following types of repositories in *Administrator* view:

* Git
* Subversion
* Maven

[id="assessing-and-analyzing-applications"]
== Assessing and analyzing applications
You can use the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} to both assess and to analyze applications.

Assessing applications refers to estimating the risks and costs involved in preparing applications for containerization, including time, personnel, and other factors. The results of an assessment can be used as the basis for discussions between stakeholders to determine which applications are good candidates for containerization, which require significant work, and which are not suitable for containerization.

Analyzing applications refers to using rules to determine which specific lines in an application must be modified before the application can be migrated or modernized.

[id=working-with-applications-in-the-ui]
== Working with Applications

You can use the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} to do the following:

* Add applications
* Assign application credentials
* Import a list of applications
* Download a CSV template for importing application lists

== Using the {WebName} to analyze applications

You can create a project in the web console to analyze your applications.

Each project groups the applications for a specific analysis, which you can configure with custom rules and labels.

The analysis process generates reports that describe the readiness of your applications for migration or modernization.
