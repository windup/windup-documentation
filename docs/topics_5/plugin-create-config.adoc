= Creating an {ProductShortName} Run Configuration

{ProductShortName} run configurations can be created using the {ProductShortName} button (image:windup.png[{ProductShortName} button]). A run configuration specifies the project to analyze, migration path, and additional options for the execution. You can create multiple run configurations, and each must have a unique name.

== Input

Migration Path::
Select a migration path, which determines which {ProductShortName} rulesets are used. The migration path defaults to *Anything to EAP 7*, but can be changed to any supported migration path.

Projects::
Select one or more projects to analyze. Hold the *Ctrl* key to select multiple projects in the list.

Packages::
Select one or more packages to scan. It is recommended to select only those packages that you need to analyze to reduce the overall {ProductShortName} execution time. If no packages are selected, all packages in the project will be scanned. Hold the *Ctrl* key to select multiple packages in the list.

== Options

Report::
Check the *Generate Report* checkbox if you want to generate the {ProductShortName} HTML report. The report will be shown in the *{ProductShortName} Report* tab and can be found in the Issue Explorer when you group by *File*.

Options::
Set additional {ProductShortName} options. Any option that is a boolean flag, such as `enableTattletale`, should use `true` as the value. See the link:{ProductDocUserGuideURL}#command_line_arguments[{ProductShortName} Command-line Arguments] section of the _{UserCLIBookName}_ for a description of each {ProductShortName} argument.

== Rules

Custom Rules Repositories::
Select custom rulesets to include during analysis if you have imported or created any custom {ProductShortName} rules in the {PluginName}.
