== Creating YAML rules

Each analyzer rule is a set of instructions that are used to analyze source code and detect issues that are problematic for migration.

The analyzer parses user-provided rules, applies them to applications' source code, and generates issues for matched rules. A collection of one or more rules forms a ruleset. Creating rulesets provides a way of organizing multiple rules that achieve a common goal. The analyzer CLI takes rulesets as input arguments.
