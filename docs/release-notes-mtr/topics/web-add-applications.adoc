= Adding applications to a project

A project must contain one or more applications.

You can add applications to a project by:

* Uploading applications
* Registering the directory path of each application

Uploading applications stores them directly on the {ProductShortName} server.

Registering the directory path of an application tells the {ProductShortName} server the location of the application. This method is useful if you expect to update the application because it ensures that the {ProductShortName} server always uses the latest version of the application.
