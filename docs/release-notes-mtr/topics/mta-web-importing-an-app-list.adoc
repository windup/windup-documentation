. Browse to the desired file and click *Open*.
. Optional: Select *Enable automatic creation of missing entities*. By default, this option is selected.
. Verify the import has completed and check the number of rows accepted or rejected.
. Review the imported applications by clicking the arrow to the left of the checkbox.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Rows accepted may not match the number of applications in the Application inventory list because some rows are dependencies.  To verify, check the *Record Type* column of the CSV file for applications defined as `1` and dependencies as `2`.
