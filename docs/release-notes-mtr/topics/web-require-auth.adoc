= Configuring authentication for the {WebName}

You can configure the {WebName} to require authentication, which is handled by Red Hat Single Sign-On. When enabled, users will be required to authenticate before being granted access to the {WebName}.

It is recommended to complete the following steps to configure authentication for the {WebName}.

. Enable authentication for the {WebName}.
+
NOTE: If you have installed {WebName} on OpenShift, authentication is already enabled and cannot be disabled.
. Change the administrative user's credentials.
. Remove the default {WebName} user.
. Add {WebName} users.
