<div class="title">CVE-2023-44487 netty-codec-http2: HTTP/2: Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)</div>
<p>A flaw was found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, which was utilized by Migration Toolkit for Runtimes (MTR). A client could repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream and immediately send an <code>RST_STREAM</code> frame to cancel it. This creates additional workload for the server in terms of setting up and dismantling streams, while avoiding any server-side limitations on the maximum number of active streams per connection, resulting in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINDUP-4072">(WINDUP-4072)</a></p>

<div class="title">CVE-2023-37460 plexus-archiver: Arbitrary File Creation in AbstractUnArchiver</div>
<p>A flaw was found in the Plexus Archiver, which was utilized by MTR. While using <code>AbstractUnArchiver</code> for extracting, an archive could lead to arbitrary file creation and possible remote code execution (RCE). This flaw will bypass directory destination verification if an archive with an entry in the destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist. The plexus-archiver is a test scoped artifact so not included in any of the MTR distributions. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINDUP-4053">(WINDUP-4053)</a></p>
