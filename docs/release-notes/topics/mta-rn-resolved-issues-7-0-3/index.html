<div class="title">CVE-2024-29180: A flaw was found in the <code>webpack-dev-middleware</code> package, where it failed to validate the supplied URL address sufficiently</div>
<p>A flaw was found in versions of the <code>webpack-dev-middleware</code> package before versions 7.1.0 and 6.1.2, in which it failed to validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning local files. This flaw allowed an attacker to craft URLs to return arbitrary local files from the developer&#8217;s machine. The lack of normalization before calling the middleware also allowed the attacker to perform path traversal attacks on the target environment.</p>

<div class="title">CVE-2023-45288: Golang: <code>net/http, x/net/http2</code>: unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack</div>
<p>A flaw was discovered with the implementation of the <code>HTTP/2</code> protocol in the Go programming language. There were insufficient limitations on the number of CONTINUATION frames sent within a single stream. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.</p>

<div class="title">CVE-2023-45857: Axios flaw can expose confidential data stored in cookies</div>
<p>A flaw was found in Axios that may expose the confidential <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code> stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header <code>X-XSRF-TOKEN</code> for every request made to any host. This issue can allow a remote attacker to bypass security measures and view sensitive data.</p>

<div class="title">CVE-2023-45286: <code>go-resty</code>: HTTP request body disclosure in github.com/go-resty/resty/v2</div>
<p>A race condition in <code>go-resty</code> can result in HTTP request body disclosure across requests. The race condition can be triggered when <code>sync.Pool.Put</code> is called with the same <code>bytes.Buffer</code> more than once during request retries. This can lead to a situation where an unrelated server receives the request body, potentially exposing sensitive information. </p>

<div class="title">CVE-2023-45287: Golang: <code>crypto/tls</code>: Timing Side Channel Attack in an RSA-Based TLS Key exchanges</div>
<p>A flaw was found in the Golang <code>crypto/tls</code> standard library. In versions before 1.20, the package was vulnerable to a Timing side-channel attack by observing the time it took for RSA-based Transport Layer Security (TLS) key exchanges, which was not constant. The flaw allowed for potential timing attacks, where the removal of <code>PKCS#1</code> padding could have leaked and potentially exposed session key bits.</p>

<p>A flaw was found in the Golang <code>net/http/internal</code> package that could cause a malicious HTTP sender to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body. This flaw could cause the receiver to fail to read the response, possibly leading to a denial of service (DoS).</p>
