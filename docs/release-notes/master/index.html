<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">The <code>Applications</code> page loads slowly when there are many applications</div>
<p>When the Application Inventory has to list many applications, the page loads slowly. Currently, there is no workaround available. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2497">(MTA-2497)</a></p>

<div class="title">Failure to run analysis on a directory of multiple applications</div>
<p>MTA 7.0.2 and 7.0.3 fail to run analysis on a directory of multiple applications. The cause of this failure is that the analyzer is expecting a <code>pom.xml</code> file in the root directory. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2765">(MTA-2765)</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Limitations with Podman on Microsoft Windows</div>
<p>The CLI is built and distributed with support for Microsoft Windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when running any container image based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL9) or Universal Base Image 9 (UBI9), the following error can be returned when starting the container:</p>

<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-terminal" data-lang="terminal">Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This error is caused because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 or Universal Base Image 9 container images must be run on a CPU architecture that supports <code>x86-64-v2</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more details, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7057314">(Running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL) or Universal Base Image (UBI) 9 container images fail with "Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2")</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CLI runs the container runtime correctly. However, different container runtime configurations are not supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although unsupported, you can run CLI with <strong>Docker</strong> instead of <strong>Podman</strong>, which would resolve this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve this, you replace the <code>PODMAN_BIN</code> path with the path to Docker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if you experience this issue, instead of issuing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-terminal" data-lang="terminal">PODMAN_BIN=/usr/local/bin/docker mta-cli analyze</code></pre>

<div class="title">CVE-2024-29180: A flaw was found in the <code>webpack-dev-middleware</code> package, where it failed to validate the supplied URL address sufficiently</div>
<p>A flaw was found in versions of the <code>webpack-dev-middleware</code> package before versions 7.1.0 and 6.1.2, in which it failed to validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning local files. This flaw allowed an attacker to craft URLs to return arbitrary local files from the developer&#8217;s machine. The lack of normalization before calling the middleware also allowed the attacker to perform path traversal attacks on the target environment.</p>

<div class="title">Limitations with Podman on Microsoft Windows</div>
<p>The CLI is built and distributed with support for Microsoft Windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when running any container image based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL9) or Universal Base Image 9 (UBI9), the following error can be returned when starting the container:</p>

<p>CLI runs the container runtime correctly. However, different container runtime configurations are not supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although unsupported, you can run CLI with <strong>Docker</strong> instead of <strong>Podman</strong>, which would resolve this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve this, you replace the <code>PODMAN_BIN</code> path with the path to Docker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if you experience this issue, instead of issuing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-terminal" data-lang="terminal">PODMAN_BIN=/usr/local/bin/docker mta-cli analyze</code></pre>

<p>To resolve this issue, whenever a custom rule has a pattern ending in <code>.{*}</code> and location <code>IMPORT</code>, the pattern <code>.{*}</code> can be changed to <code>{*}</code> and the location changed to <code>PACKAGE</code>, as in the following example.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following highlighted issues have been resolved in Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) version 7.0.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">No update notification after editing fields</div>
<p>In previous versions of MTA, no <code>Update Notification</code> appeared at top of window after the fields <code>Application</code>, <code>Job Function</code>, and <code>Business services</code> were updated. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1024">MTA-1024</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Not possible to create a Jira instance behind a proxy</div>
<p>In previous versions of MTA, it was not possible to create a Jira instance (issues.stage.redhat.com) behind a proxy. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-849">MTA-849</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">CVE-2023-6291: A flaw was found in the <code>redirect_uri validation</code> logic</div>
<p>A flaw was found in the <code>redirect_uri validation</code> logic that allows for a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts. The problem arises in the <code>verifyRedirectUri</code> method, which attempts to enforce rules on <code>user-controllable</code> input, but can cause a desynchronization in how Keycloak and browsers interpret URLs.</p>

<h3 id="mta-rn-upgrade-notes-7-0-0_release-notes">5.4. Upgrade notes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following are upgrade notes for Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Hub database volume size</div>
<p>In version 7.0.0 of MTA, the default size of the hub database volume has been increased to 10GiB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your storage class does not support volume expansion, then an upgrade from 6.2.1 to 7.0.0 will result in a failure due to the operator trying to change the volume size from 5GiB to 10GiB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To avoid this issue, you can directly set the volume size by setting:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">...
hub_database_volume_size: 5Gi
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By doing this, you will avoid the operator trying to resize the volume.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this value was set when the previous version was deployed, there is no need to take any action, as it will work as expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Existing data</div>
<p>When upgrading to MTA 7.0.0, all existing data will be retained, except for individual analysis reports for applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As both the analysis and reporting engines have been replaced with this version, you will be required to conduct a re-run of the analysis in order to obtain data on issues and dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Version upgrade</div>
<p>You can upgrade to MTA 7.0.0 from 6.2.1. It is not recommended to pursue any alternative upgrade route. If you wish to upgrade from a previous version, it is recommended to proceed in a sequential manner until you finally upgrade from MTA version 6.2.1 to 7.0.0.</p>
