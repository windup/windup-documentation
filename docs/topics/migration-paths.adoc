= Supported {ProductName} migration paths

The {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) supports the following migrations:

* Migrating from third-party enterprise application servers, such as Oracle WebLogic Server, to JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP).
* Upgrading to the latest release of JBoss EAP.

* Migrating from a Windows-only .NET 4.5 Framework to a cross-platform .NET 8.0 framework
