= Understanding the {WebName} image

Red Hat offers containerized images for {ProductShortName} that are designed for use with OpenShift Container Platform. Using these images developers can quickly and easily manage migration projects and analyze applications.

The {ProductShortName} image installs the following Pods:

* The Executor Pod runs analyses and generates reports
* The Web Console + Red Hat Single Sign-on (SSO) Pod provides access to the web console
* The PostgreSQL Pod stores the project's configuration and analysis tracking information

A separate persistent volume is used for the {WebName} interface and the PostgreSQL Pods. The Executor Pod's storage is dependent on the template used.

* The `web-template-empty-dir-executor.json` is the recommended template. It configures the Executor Pod to use temporary storage on a single machine and has no defined persistent volume. The analysis data is sent between the Executor and Web Console Pods using a RESTful web service.

* The `web-template-empty-dir-executor-shared-storage.json` is an alternative template. This template configures the Executor Pod and the Web Console Pod to use a shared persistent volume. All instances of these Pods read and write to the same persistent volume, mounted as `ReadWriteMany` in OpenShift.

== OpenShift template environment variables

The OpenShift image environment variables are configured as a baseline for application analysis, and work well in a variety of environments. No additional configuration is required to perform an analysis.

The most common environment variables modified are the CPU and memory resources allocated to each image. These contain a pattern of `<NODE_NAME>` followed by `<REQUESTED_RESOURCE>`. For instance, `EXECUTOR_REQUESTED_CPU` indicates the number of CPU cores to request for the executor pod, while `EXECUTOR_REQUESTED_MEMORY` indicates the amount of memory to request for the executor pod.

All of the environment variables are found within each template, along with a description of each.
