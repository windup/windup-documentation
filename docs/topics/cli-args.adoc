= About {ProductShortName} command-line arguments

The following is a detailed description of the available {ProductShortName} command line arguments.

[NOTE]
====
To run the {ProductShortName} command without prompting, for example when executing from a script, you must use the following arguments:

* `--batchMode`
* `--overwrite`
* `--input`
* `--target`
====

.{ProductShortName} CLI arguments
[cols="40%,60%a",options="header",]
|====
|Argument |Description
|--additionalClassPath |A space-delimited list of additional JAR files or directories to add to the class path so that they are available for decompilation or other analysis.
|--addonDir |Add the specified directory as a custom add-on repository.
|--analyzeKnownLibraries | Flag to analyze known software artifacts embedded within your application. By default, {ProductShortName} only analyzes application code.

[NOTE]
====
This option may result in a longer execution time and a large number of migration issues being reported.
====

|--batchMode |Flag to specify that {ProductShortName} should be run in a non-interactive mode without prompting for confirmation. This mode takes the default values for any parameters not passed in to the command line.
|--debug |Flag to run {ProductShortName} in debug mode.
|--disableTattletale | Flag to disable generation of the Tattletale report. If both `enableTattletale` and `disableTattletale` are set to true, then `disableTattletale` will be ignored and the Tattletale report will still be generated.
|--discoverPackages |Flag to list all available packages in the input binary application.
|--enableClassNotFoundAnalysis |Flag to enable analysis of Java files that are not available on the class path. This should not be used if some classes will be unavailable at analysis time.
|--enableCompatibleFilesReport |Flag to enable generation of the Compatible Files report. Due to processing all files without found issues, this report may take a long time for large applications.
|--enableTattletale |Flag to enable generation of a Tattletale report for each application. This option is enabled by default when `eap` is in the included target. If both `enableTattletale` and `disableTattletale` are set to true, then `disableTattletale` will be ignored and the Tattletale report will still be generated.
|--excludePackages |A space-delimited list of packages to exclude from evaluation. For example, entering `com.mycompany.commonutilities` would exclude all classes whose package name begins with `com.mycompany.commonutilities`.
|--excludeTags |A space-delimited list of tags to exclude. When specified, rules with these tags will not be processed. To see the full list of tags, use the `--listTags` argument.
|--explodedApp |Flag to indicate that the provided input directory contains source files for a single application.
|--exportCSV |Flag to export the report data to a CSV file on your local file system. {ProductShortName} creates the file in the directory specified by the `--output` argument. The CSV file can be imported into a spreadsheet program for data manipulation and analysis.
|--help |Display the {ProductShortName} help message.
|--immutableAddonDir |Add the specified directory as a custom read-only add-on repository.
|--includeTags| A space-delimited list of tags to use. When specified, only rules with these tags will be processed. To see the full list of tags, use the `--listTags` argument.
|--input |A space-delimited list of the path to the file or directory containing one or more applications to be analyzed. This argument is required.
|--install |Specify add-ons to install. The syntax is `<GROUP_ID>:<ARTIFACT_ID>[:<VERSION>]`. For example, `--install core-addon-x` or `--install org.example.addon:example:1.0.0`.
|--keepWorkDirs| Flag to instruct {ProductShortName} to not delete temporary working files, such as the graph database and extracted archive files. This is useful for debugging purposes.
|--list| Flag to list installed add-ons.
|--listSourceTechnologies| Flag to list all available source technologies.
|--listTags| Flag to list all available tags.
|--listTargetTechnologies| Flag to list all available target technologies.
|--mavenize| Flag to create a Maven project directory structure based on the structure and content of the application. This creates `pom.xml` files using the appropriate Java EE API and the correct dependencies between project modules. See also the `--mavenizeGroupId` option.
|--mavenizeGroupId| When used with the `--mavenize` option, all generated `pom.xml` files will use the provided value for their `<groupId>`. If this argument is omitted, {ProductShortName} will attempt to determine an appropriate `<groupId>` based on the application, or will default to `com.mycompany.mavenized`.
|--online |Flag to allow network access for features that require it. Currently only validating XML schemas against external resources relies on Internet access. Note that this comes with a performance penalty.
|--output |Specify the path to the directory to output the report information generated by {ProductShortName}.
|--overwrite |Flag to force delete the existing output directory specified by `--output`. If you do not specify this argument and the `--output` directory exists, you are prompted to choose whether to overwrite the contents.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not overwrite a report output directory that contains important information.
====

|--packages| A space-delimited list of the packages to be evaluated by {ProductShortName}. It is highly recommended to use this argument.
|--remove |Remove the specified add-ons. The syntax is `<GROUP_ID>:<ARTIFACT_ID>[:<VERSION>]`. For example, `--remove core-addon-x` or `--remove org.example.addon:example:1.0.0`.
|--skipReports |Flag to indicate that HTML reports should not be generated. A common use of this argument is when exporting report data to a CSV file using `--exportCSV`.
|--source |A space-delimited list of one or more source technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate from. This argument, in conjunction with the `--target` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. Use the `--listSourceTechnologies` argument to list all available sources.
|--sourceMode |Flag to indicate that the application to be evaluated contains source files rather than compiled binaries.
|--target |A space-delimited list of one or more target technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate to. This argument, in conjunction with the `--source` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. Use the `--listTargetTechnologies` argument to list all available targets.
|--userIgnorePath |Specify a location, in addition to `${user.home}/.mta/ignore/`, for {ProductShortName} to identify files that should be ignored.
|--userLabelsDirectory |Specify a location for {ProductShortName} to look for custom Target Runtime Labels. The value can be a directory containing label files or a single label file. The Target Runtime Label files must use either the [x-]`.windup.label.xml` or [x-]`.mta.label.xml` suffix. The shipped Target Runtime Labels are defined within `${ProductShortName}_HOME/rules/migration-core/core.windup.label.xml`.
|--userRulesDirectory |Specify a location, in addition to `<{ProductShortName}_HOME>/rules/` and `${user.home}/.mta/rules/`, for {ProductShortName} to look for custom {ProductShortName} rules. The value can be a directory containing ruleset files or a single ruleset file. The ruleset files must use the [x-]`.windup.xml` or [x-]`.mta.xml` suffix.
|--version |Display the {ProductShortName} version.

[id="cli-input-argument_{context}"]
== Specifying the input

A space-delimited list of the path to the file or directory containing one or more applications to be analyzed. This argument is required.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--input <INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_DIRECTORY> [...]
----

[id="cli-input-file-type-arguments_{context}"]

Depending on whether the input file type provided to the `--input` argument is a file or directory, it will be evaluated as follows depending on the additional arguments provided.

Directory::
+
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|====
| --explodedApp
| --sourceMode
| Neither Argument

| The directory is evaluated as a single application.
| The directory is evaluated as a single application.
| Each subdirectory is evaluated as an application.
|====

File::
+
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|====
| --explodedApp
| --sourceMode
| Neither Argument

| Argument is ignored; the file is evaluated as a single application.
| The file is evaluated as a compressed project.
| The file is evaluated as a single application.
|====

[id="cli-output-argument_{context}"]
== Specifying the output directory

Specify the path to the directory to output the report information generated by {ProductShortName}.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--output <OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY>
----

* If omitted, the report will be generated in an `<INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_DIRECTORY>.report` directory.
* If the output directory exists, you will be prompted with the following (with a default of N).
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
Overwrite all contents of "/home/username/<OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY>" (anything already in the directory will be deleted)? [y,N]
----

However, if you specify the `--overwrite` argument, {ProductShortName} will proceed to delete and recreate the directory. See the description of this argument for more information.

[id="cli-source-argument_{context}"]
== Setting the source technology

A space-delimited list of one or more source technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate from. This argument, in conjunction with the `--target` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. Use the `--listSourceTechnologies` argument to list all available sources.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--source <SOURCE_1> <SOURCE_2>
----

The `--source` argument now provides version support, which follows the link:http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html[Maven version range syntax]. This instructs {ProductShortName} to only run the rulesets matching the specified versions. For example, `--source eap:5`.

[WARNING]
====
When migrating to JBoss EAP, be sure to specify the version, for example, `eap:6`. Specifying only `eap` will run rulesets for all versions of JBoss EAP, including those not relevant to your migration path.

See link:{ProductDocIntroToMTAGuideURL}/index#migration_paths_getting-started-guide[Supported migration paths] in _{IntroToMTABookName}_ for the appropriate JBoss EAP version.
====

[id="cli-target-argument_{context}"]
== Setting the target technology

A space-delimited list of one or more target technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate to. This argument, in conjunction with the `--source` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. If you do not specify this option, you are prompted to select a target. Use the `--listTargetTechnologies` argument to list all available targets.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--target <TARGET_1> <TARGET_2>
----


The `--target` argument now provides version support, which follows the link:http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html[Maven version range syntax]. This instructs {ProductShortName} to only run the rulesets matching the specified versions. For example, `--target eap:7`.

[WARNING]
====
When migrating to JBoss EAP, be sure to specify the version in the target, for example, `eap:6`. Specifying only `eap` will run rulesets for all versions of JBoss EAP, including those not relevant to your migration path.

See link:{ProductDocIntroToMTAGuideURL}/index#migration_paths_getting-started-guide[Supported migration paths] in _{IntroToMTABookName}_ for the appropriate JBoss EAP version.
====

[id="cli-packages-argument_{context}"]
== Selecting packages

A space-delimited list of the packages to be evaluated by {ProductShortName}. It is highly recommended to use this argument.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--packages <PACKAGE_1> <PACKAGE_2> <PACKAGE_N>
----

* In most cases, you are interested only in evaluating custom application class packages and not standard Java EE or third party packages. The `<PACKAGE_N>` argument is a package prefix; all subpackages will be scanned. For example, to scan the packages `com.mycustomapp` and `com.myotherapp`, use `--packages com.mycustomapp com.myotherapp` argument on the command line.
* While you can provide package names for standard Java EE third party software like `org.apache`, it is usually best not to include them as they should not impact the migration effort.

[WARNING]
====
If you omit the `--packages` argument, every package in the application is scanned, which can impact performance.
