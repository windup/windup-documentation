= {MavenNameTitle} Arguments

The following is a detailed description of the available {ProductShortName} {MavenName} arguments.

.{ProductShortName} {MavenName} Arguments
[cols="40%,60%a",options="header"]
|====
|Argument |Description
|customLoggingPropertiesFile |An absolute path to a `logging.properties` file that contains a `java.util.logging.LogManager` logging configuration. If the specified path is invalid, or the option is not specified, then the logging reverts to using the xref:logging_properties[`logging.properties`] file included with the {MavenName}.
|disableTattletale | Flag to disable generation of the Tattletale report. If both `enableTattletale` and `disableTattletale` are set to true, then `disableTattletale` will be ignored and the Tattletale report will still be generated.
|enableCompatibleFilesReport |Flag to enable generation of the Compatible Files report. Due to processing all files without found issues, this report may take a long time for large applications.
|enableTattletale |Flag to enable generation of a Tattletale report for each application. This option is enabled by default when `eap` is in the included target. If both `enableTattletale` and `disableTattletale` are set to true, then `disableTattletale` will be ignored and the Tattletale report will still be generated.
|excludePackages |A list of packages to exclude from evaluation. For example, entering "com.mycompany.commonutilities" would exclude all classes whose package name begins with "com.mycompany.commonutilities".
|excludeTags |A list of tags to exclude. When specified, rules with these tags will not be processed.
|explodedApps |Flag to indicate that the provided input directory contains source files for a single application. See the xref:input_file_type_arguments[Input File Argument Tables] for details.
|exportCSV |Flag to export the report data to a CSV file on your local file system. {ProductShortName} creates the file in the directory specified by the `outputDirectory` argument. The CSV file can be imported into a spreadsheet program for data manipulation and analysis. For details, see xref:export_csv[Export the Report in CSV Format].
|includeTags |A list of tags to use. When specified, only rules with these tags will be processed. 
|inputDirectory |Specify the path to the directory containing the applications to be analyzed. This argument defaults to `{project.basedir}/src/main/`. See xref:input_argument[Specify the Input Directory] for more information.
|keepWorkDirs |Flag to instruct {ProductShortName} to not delete temporary working files, such as the graph database and unzipped archives. This is useful for debugging purposes.
|packages |A list of the packages to be evaluated by {ProductShortName}. This argument is required. See xref:packages_argument[Select Packages] for more information.
|offlineMode |Flag to operate in offline mode, disabling network access features, such as scheme validation. Used to improve performance. 
|outputDirectory |Specify the path to the directory to output the report information generated by {ProductShortName}. This argument defaults to `{project.build.directory}/windup-report`. See xref:output_argument[Specify the Output Directory] for more information.
|overwrite |Flag to force delete the existing output directory specified by `outputDirectory`. Defaults to `true`.

[WARNING]
====
Be careful not to specify a report output directory that contains important information!
====

|sourceTechnologies |A list of one or more source technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate from. This argument, in conjunction with the `targetTechnologies` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. See xref:source_argument[Set the Source Technology] for more information.
|sourceMode |Flag to indicate that the application to be evaluated contains source files rather than compiled binaries. Defaults to `true`. See the xref:input_file_type_arguments[Input File Argument Tables] for details.
|targetTechnologies |A list of one or more target technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate to. This argument, in conjunction with the `sourceTechnologies` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. See xref:target_argument[Set the Target Technology] for more information.
|userIgnorePath |Specify a location for {ProductShortName} to identify files that should be ignored.
|userRulesDirectory |Specify a location for {ProductShortName} to look for custom {ProductShortName} rules. The value can be a directory containing ruleset files or a single ruleset file. The ruleset files must use the [x-]`.windup.xml` or [x-]`.rhamt.xml` suffix.
|windupHome |An optional argument that points to the root of an extracted {ProductShortName} {CLIName}. By referencing a local installation of the {CLIName}, the {MavenName} has direct access to all of the indexes, resulting in a performance increase.
|windupVersion |Specify the version of {ProductShortName} to run. By default, this is the {MavenName}'s build version.
|====

[[input_argument]]
== Specify the Input Directory

A path to the file or directory containing one or more applications to be analyzed. This defaults to `{project.basedir}/src/main/`.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
<inputDirectory>__INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_DIRECTORY__</inputDirectory>
----

[[input_file_type_arguments]]

Depending on whether the input file type provided to the `inputDirectory` argument is a file or directory, it will be evaluated as follows depending on the additional arguments provided.

Directory::
+
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|====
| --explodedApp
| --sourceMode
| Neither Argument

| The directory is evaluated as a single application.
| The directory is evaluated as a single application.
| Each subdirectory is evaluated as an application.
|====

File::
+
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|====
| --explodedApp
| --sourceMode
| Neither Argument

| Argument is ignored; the file is evaluated as a single application.
| The file is evaluated as a compressed project.
| The file is evaluated as a single application.
|====

[[output_argument]]
== Specify the Output Directory

Specify the path to the directory to output the report information generated by {ProductShortName}.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
<outputDirectory>__OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY__</outputDirectory>
----

* If omitted, the report will be generated in the `{project.build.directory}/windup-report` directory.
* If the output directory exists, it will be overwritten based on the value of the `overwrite` argument. This argument defaults to `true`, and causes {ProductShortName} to delete and recreate the directory.

[[source_argument]]
== Set the Source Technology

A list of one or more source technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate from. This argument, in conjunction with the `targetTechnologies` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
<sourceTechnologies>
    <source>eap:6</source>
</sourceTechnologies>
----

The `sourceTechnologies` argument now provides version support, which follows the link:http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html[Maven version range syntax]. This instructs {ProductShortName} to only run the rulesets matching the specified versions. For example, `<source>eap:5</source>`.

[[target_argument]]
== Set the Target Argument

A list of one or more target technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate to. This argument, in conjunction with the `sourceTechnologies` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. This argument is required

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
<targetTechnologies>
  <target>eap:7</target>
</targetTechnologies>
----

The `targetTechnologies` argument now provides version support, which follows the link:http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html[Maven version range syntax]. This instructs {ProductShortName} to only run the rulesets matching the specified versions. For example, `<target>eap:7</target>`.

[WARNING]
====
When migrating to JBoss EAP, be sure to specify the version in the target, for example, `eap:6`. Specifying only `eap` will run rulesets for all versions of JBoss EAP, including those not relevant to your migration path.

See link:{ProductDocGettingStartedGuideURL}#migration_paths[Supported Migration Paths] in the {ProductShortName} _{GettingStartedBookName}_ for which JBoss EAP version is appropriate for your source platform.
====

[[packages_argument]]
== Select Packages

A list of the packages to be evaluated by {ProductShortName}. It is highly recommended to use this argument.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
<packages>
  <package>__PACKAGE_1__</package>
  <package>__PACKAGE_2__</package>
</packages>
----

* In most cases, you are interested only in evaluating custom application class packages and not standard Java EE or third party packages. The `__PACKAGE_N__` argument is a package prefix; all subpackages will be scanned. For example, to scan the packages `com.mycustomapp` and `com.myotherapp`, use the following snippet in your `pom.xml`.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
<packages>
  <package>com.mycustomapp</package>
  <package>com.myotherapp</package>
</packages>
----
* While you can provide package names for standard Java EE third party software like `org.apache`, it is usually best not to include them as they should not impact the migration effort.

// WARNING: If you omit the `packages` argument, every package in the application is scanned, which can impact performance. It is best to provide this argument with one or more packages. For additional tips on how to improve performance, see xref:optimize_performance[Optimize {ProductShortName} Performance].
