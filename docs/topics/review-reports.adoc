=== Application Details Report

Access this report from the dashboard by clicking the *Application Details* link.

The report lists the story points, the Java incidents by package, and a count of the occurrences of the technologies found in the application. Next is a display of application messages generated during the migration process. Finally, there is a breakdown of this information for each archive analyzed during the process.

.Application Details Report
image::report-jee-example-application-details.png[Application Details Report]

Expand the `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear/jee-example-services.jar` to review the story points, Java incidents by package, and a count of the occurrences of the technologies found in this archive. This summary begins with a total of the story points assigned to its migration, followed by a table detailing the changes required for each file in the archive. The report contains the following columns.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|====
| Column Name
| Description

| Name
| The name of the file being analyzed.

| Technology
| The type of file being analyzed, for example, *Decompiled Java File* or *Properties*.

| Issues
| Warnings about areas of code that need review or changes.

| Story Points
a| Level of effort required to migrate the file. See xref:rule_story_points[Rule Story Points] for more details.
|====

Note that if an archive is duplicated several times in an application, it will be listed just once in the report and will be tagged with `[Included Multiple Times]`.

.Duplicate Archive in an Application
image::duplicate-archive-app-report.png[Duplicate Archive]

The story points for archives that are duplicated within an application will be counted only once in the total story point count for that application.

=== Source Report

The analysis of the `jee-example-services.jar` lists the files in the JAR and the warnings and story points assigned to each one. Notice the `com.acme.anvil.listener.AnvilWebLifecycleListener` file, at the time of this test, has 22 warnings and is assigned 16 story points. Click on the file link to see the detail.

* The *Information* section provides a summary of the story points.
* This is followed by the file source code. Warnings appear in the file at the point where  migration is required.

In this example, warnings appear at various import statements, declarations, and method calls. Each warning describes the issue and the action that should be taken.
