=== Application dependencies graph report

The analyzed applications' dependencies are shown in this report, accessible from the *Dependencies Graph* link from the dashboard.

It includes a list of all WARs and JARs, including third-party JARs, and graphs the relations between each of the included files. Each circle in the graph represents a unique dependency defined in the application.

The below image shows the dependencies used in the `jee-example-app`, with the selected application in the center of the graph.

.Graph of dependencies in an application
image::report-jee-example-application-dependencies.png[Dependencies Graph application view]

.Interacting with the Dependencies graph

The dependencies graph may be adjusted by using any of the following.

* Clicking a dependency will display the name of the application in the upper-left corner. While selected the dependency will have a shaded circle identifying it, as seen on the center in the above image.
* Clicking and dragging a circle will reposition it. Releasing the mouse will fix the dependency to the cursor's location.
* Clicking on a fixed dependency will release it, returning the dependency to its default distance from the application.
* Double clicking anywhere will return the entire graph to the default state.
* Clicking on any item in the legend will enable or disable all items of the selected type. For instance, selecting the embedded WARs icon will disable all embedded WARs if these are enabled, and will enable these dependencies if they are disabled.

=== Transactions report

A Transactions report displays the call stack, which executes operations on relational database tables. The Enable Transaction Analysis feature supports Spring Data JPA and the traditional `preparedStatement()` method for SQL statement execution. It does not support ORM frameworks, such as Hibernate.

=== Source report

The analysis of the `jee-example-services.jar` lists the files in the JAR and the warnings and story points assigned to each one. Notice the `com.acme.anvil.listener.AnvilWebLifecycleListener` file, at the time of this test, has 22 warnings and is assigned 16 story points. Click the file link to see the detail.

* The *Information* section provides a summary of the story points.
* This is followed by the file source code. Warnings appear in the file at the point where  migration is required.

In this example, warnings appear at various import statements, declarations, and method calls. Each warning describes the issue and the action that should be taken.
