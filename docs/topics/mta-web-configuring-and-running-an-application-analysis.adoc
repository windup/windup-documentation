[id="mta-web-configuring-and-running-an-application-analysis_{context}"]
= Configuring and running an application analysis

You can analyze more than one application at a time against more than one transformation target in the same analysis.

.Procedure

. In *Migration* view, click *Application inventory*.
. Click the *Analysis* tab.
. Select the applications you want to analyze.
+
// ![](/Tackle2/AppAssessAnalyze/SelectManageCred.png)

. Review the credentials assigned to the application.
. Click *Analyze*.
+
// ![](/Tackle2/AppAssessAnalyze/AnalysisMode.png)

. Select the *Analysis mode* from the list. Valid options are:
* Binary.
* Source code.
* Source code and dependencies.
* Upload a local binary. This option only appears if you are analyzing a single application.

. If you choose *Upload a local binary*, a window opens and you are prompted to *Upload a local binary*. Either drag and drop a file into the area provided or click *Upload* and then select the file to upload.

. Click *Next*.
. Select one or more target options for the analysis:

* Application server migration to:
** JBoss EAP 7
** JBoss EAP 8
* Containerization
* Quarkus
* OracleJDK to OpenJDK
* OpenJDK - upgrades to one of the following JDK versions:
** OpenJDK 11
** OpenJDK 17
** OpenJDK 21
* Linux - ensures there are no Microsoft Windows paths hard-coded into your applications
* Jakarta EE 9 - for migrating from Java EE 8 to Jakarta EE 9
* Spring Boot on Red Hat Runtimes
* Open Liberty
* Camel - for migrating from Apache Camel 2 to Apache Camel 3 and Apache Camel 4


. Click *Next*.
. Select one of the following *Scope* options to better focus the analysis:

* Application and internal dependencies only.
* Application and all dependencies, including known Open Source libraries.
* Select the list of packages to be analyzed manually. If you choose this option, type the file name and click *Add*.
* Exclude packages. If you choose this option, type the name of the package name and click *Add*.

. Click *Next*.
. In *Advanced*, you can attach additional custom rules to the analysis. Select *Manual* or *Repository*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Attaching custom rules is optional if you have already attached a migration target to the analysis. If you have not attached any migration target, you must attach rules.
====
** In *Manual* mode, click *Add Rules*. Then either drag and drop the relevant files or select them from their directory and click *Add*.
** In *Repository* mode, you can add rule files from a Git or Subversion repository.
. Set any of the following options, if needed:

* Target
* Source(s)
* Excluded rules tags: Rules with these tags are not processed. Add or delete as needed.
* Enable transaction report: Select the checkbox to generate a DIVA report that displays the call stack, which executes operations on relational database tables.
* Enable automated tagging: Select the checkbox to automatically attach tags to the application. This checkbox is selected by default.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Transactions report is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Automatically attached tags are displayed only _after_ you run the analysis.

You can attach tags to the application manually, instead of enabling automated tagging or in addition to it.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Analysis engines use standard rules for a comprehensive set of migration targets, but if the target is not included or is a customized framework, custom rules can be added. Custom rules files are validated.
====

. Click *Next*.
. In *Review*, verify the analysis parameters.
. Click *Run*.
+
Analysis status is `Scheduled` as {ProductShortName} downloads the image for the container to execute. When the image is downloaded, the status changes to `In-progress.`
+
[NOTE]
====
Analysis takes minutes to hours to run depending on the size of the application and the capacity and resources of the cluster.
====
+
[TIP]
====
{ProductShortName} relies on Kubernetes scheduling capabilities to determine how many analyzer instances are created based on cluster capacity. If several applications are selected for analysis, by default, only one analyzer can be provisioned at a time.  With more cluster capacity, more analysis processes can be executed in parallel.
====
. When analysis is complete, you can click the *Report* link to see the results of the analysis.

[id="viewing-analysis-details_{context}"]
== Viewing analysis details

You can view the details of an analysis by clicking the Options menu {kebab} and selecting *Analysis details*. The details are displayed in the *Analysis details for customers* window. You can choose either YAML or JSON format.

[NOTE]
====
You can view the details of an analysis only after you start running the analysis. If the status of an analysis is *Not started*, the *Analysis details* option is disabled.
