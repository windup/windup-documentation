= Reviewing issues

You can use the {ProductShortName} plugin icons to prioritize issues based on their severity. You can see which issues have a _Quick Fix_ automatic code replacement and which do not.

The results of an analysis are displayed in a directory format, showing the _hints_ and _classifications_ for each application analyzed.

A _hint_ is a read-only snippet of code that contains a single issue that you should or must address before you can modernize or migrate an application. Often a Quick Fix is suggested, which you can accept or ignore.

A _classification_ is a file that has an issue but does not have any suggested Quick Fixes. You can edit a classification.

.Procedure

. In the {ProductName} view, select a run configuration directory in the left pane.
+
. Click *Results*.
+
The modules and applications of the run configuration are displayed, with hints and classifications beneath each application.

. Prioritize issues based on the following icons, which are displayed next to each hint:

** image:intellij-idea-mandatory.png[Mandatory] : You must fix this issue in order to migrate or modernize the application.
** image:intellij-idea-potential.png[Warning] : You might need to fix this issue in order to migrate or modernize the application

. Optional: To learn more about a hint, right-click it and select *Show More Details*.
