= Resolving issues

You can resolve issues by doing one of the following:

* Using a _Quick Fix_ to fix a code snippet that has a hint
* Editing the code of a file that appears in a classification

== Using a Quick Fix

You can use a Quick Fix automatic code replacement to save time and ensure consistency in resolving repetitive issues. Quick Fixes are available for many issues displayed in the *Hints* section of the *Results* directory.

.Procedure

. In the left pane, click a hint that has an error indicator.
+
Any Quick Fixes are displayed as child folders with the Quick Fix icon (image:intellij-idea-info.png[Quickfix]) on their left side.
. Right-click a Quick Fix and select *Preview Quick Fix*.
+
The current code and the suggested change are displayed in the *Preview Quick Fix* window.
. To accept the suggested fix, click *Apply Quick Fix*.
. Optional: Right-click the issue and select *Mark As Complete*.
+
A green check (image:intellij-idea-ok.png[Complete]) is displayed by the hint, replacing the error indicator.

== Editing the code of a file

You can directly edit a file displayed in the *Classifications* section of the *Results* directory. These files do not have any Quick Fixes.

.Procedure

. In the left pane, click the file you want to edit.
. Make any changes needed to the code and save the file.
. Optional: Right-click the issue and select *Mark as Complete* or *Delete*.
+
If you select *Mark as Complete*, a green check (image:intellij-idea-ok.png[Complete]) is displayed by the hint, replacing the error indicator.
